## ConningTower for iOS

ConningTower for iOS is a closed-source branch independent of the ConningTower open-source project. The two are not equal. ConningTower for iOS is not a third-party client of KanColle, it is a universal web game browser. While the ConningTower iOS version will make special adaptations to some web page windows, this application is not aimed at any specific website.

[ConningTower for iOS](https://conntower.github.io/#/ios) is now on the AppStore.

Free version ConningTowerLite is a lightweight version of ConningTower for iOS. Runs more smoothly.

Download ConningTowerLite for free.👇

## About

Conning Tower is design to play KanColle on single app include assistant utilities.
Now available on iOS and Android.
The minimum OS versions are iOS 11.0 and Android 4.4.
Best platform suggest is iPad.
Will support macOS, Windows and Linux in the future.

## Why start this project

Playing KanColle on iOS is not easy.
KanColle player data on the Android 3rd party browsers cannot sync with desktop platform browsers.
And there is no one software to play KanColle on mobile platform and desktop platform.

This project goal is use same UI and be able to sync player data on all platforms.
